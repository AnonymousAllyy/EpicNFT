# Hardhat Project to mint NFTs

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It will let users connect their Ethereum wallet, and mint an NFT to their wallet so they actually own it. The NFT itself can be customized to whatever you want.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
